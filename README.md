# Project Senario ðŸ—º
This project is an end-to-end ELT pipeline that automates the extraction, loading, and transformation of stock market data for the five largest tourism companies. It leverages Airbyte to extract data from the Polygon API and load it into BigQuery. dbt is used to perform transformations and generate reusable data for analysis, while Airflow orchestrates the entire workflow with daily automation. All services are deployed using Docker.
